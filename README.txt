-Using TreeSet for Containing Users because its efficient at searching, plus it doesn't allow duplicates.
-Using TreeMap for Containing Usernames and Passwords because its also efficient at searching,
plus it doesn't allow duplicates.
-Using TreeSet for Containing Trails because it has fast searching and doesn't allow duplicates and doesn't need a key.
-Using LinkedList for Containing Reviews, Comments, and Hiking History because, it has an O(1) for insertion and deletion,
plus it stays in order of insertion. I also don't need to search for a specific review, comment, or hiking history.
